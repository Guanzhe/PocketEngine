http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

and follow the instructions to install Emscripten

edit the Build.sh script in this folder to point to where you installed Emscripten:

e.g:

EMSCRIPTEN_PATH=“/emsdk_portable/emscripten/1.29.0/“

next open a terminal and go to this folder and type:

sh build.sh

this will create 2 files (after a while):

PocketEngine.html

Open PocketEngine.html in your favorite browser and voila c++ right there in your browser.
It even works on modern mobile browsers such as safari and chrome.
